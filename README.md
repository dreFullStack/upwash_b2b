# upwash_b2b
This project was developed for Upwash (https://www.upwash.fi/) which is a company that provides car washes while bringing the services to a customer's location. The application would serve B2B customers as a platform to manage their car fleets allowing:
- creating fleets and adding fleet related information like City, Address, Fleet Manager (person in response),
- importing vehicles either through a form or with CSV format file,
- placing orders, browsing orders history,
- adding invoicing information,
- sending support request.

Tech stack: 
- React with Material UI,
- ExpressJS,
- MySQL with ORM Prisma,
- JWT and Redux for auth.
